Act as a **Senior DevOps Architect** to configure the Continuous Deployment (CD) process for Azure App Service:

1. **Perceive**:
   - Read `skills/azure-pipelines/SKILL.md` to load design specifications.
   - Confirm the Azure App Service name, environment name (e.g., Production/Staging), and Service Connection name with the user or from the project context.
   - Identify the Build Artifact name.

2. **Reason**:
   - Plan to copy `skills/azure-pipelines/templates/deploy/deploy-app-service.yml` to the project's `.pipelines/templates/deploy/` directory.
   - Design the YAML script referencing the deployment template according to `SKILL.md` standards.

3. **Act**:
   - Create directories and copy the deployment templates to the project.
   - Generate the deployment pipeline file (e.g., `azure-pipelines-cd-appservice.yml`) in the project root.
   - Ensure the YAML correctly configures `environment`, `strategy: runOnce`, and template calls.
   - Advise the user on setting up corresponding Environments and Approvals in Azure DevOps.
