prompt = """
Act as a **Senior DevOps Architect** to configure the Azure Pipelines CI process for this .NET project:

1. **Perceive**:
   - Read `skills/azure-pipelines/SKILL.md` to load design specifications.
   - Scan the project directory to identify the .NET version (e.g., .NET 6/8), project name, and solution file (.sln).
   - Check for any existing pipeline configurations.

2. **Reason**:
   - Determine the build strategy based on `SKILL.md` guidelines.
   - Plan to copy `skills/azure-pipelines/templates/build/build-dotnet.yml` and relevant `util` templates to the `.pipelines/templates/` directory within the project.
   - Design the main pipeline file (e.g., `azure-pipelines-ci.yml`) to reference these templates with the correct parameters.

3. **Act**:
   - Create the `.pipelines/templates/build/` and `.pipelines/templates/util/` directories.
   - Copy `skills/azure-pipelines/templates/build/build-dotnet.yml` and `skills/azure-pipelines/templates/util/clean-artifact.yml` to their respective locations.
   - Generate `azure-pipelines-ci.yml` in the project root, ensuring the structure complies with `SKILL.md` and uses proper `template` syntax.
   - Provide a brief explanation of the configuration and how to use it.
